def generate_default() -> Tuple[Set[ExchangeClient], List[Tuple[ExchangeClient, str]]]:
    """
    Generates the default set of exchange clients and those clients with the
    pair should be called.

    The shape of this data is just what made sense at the time and is subject
    to change! :)


    Note on ``ExchangeClient.fast == True``:
        When giving an `ExchangeClient` the attribute of `fast = True` it will
        be considered in `generate_fast()` this is a rudimentary approach to
        giving this library some flexibility over aggregation of results from
        several sources, even if those sources may be duplicates of direct
        clients provided by ``ccxt``, the more ExchangeClients and pairs to
        call during aggregation seems useful as well, even if it is biasing the
        data those exchanges that are called, it is implicit these calls will
        be staggered over multiple loops of aggregation through ccxt's own
        `ccxt.base.exchange.Exchange` which has attached market data we're
        currently not utilizing, for the price aggregate function

        Some `ccxt.base.exchange.Exchange`s are faster than others, and can be
        considered to be included in the `generate_fast()` method by attaching
        the attribute directly:

            # example where we could set a ccxt client as 'fast' directly, not really
            # intelligent, just empirical through synthetic trials
